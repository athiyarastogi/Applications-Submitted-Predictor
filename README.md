 # Applications Submitted Predictor


# Purpose

Applications Submitted Predictor is designed to predict 'Number of Applications Submitted' based on 'Applications Created' in a system and  'Application forms downloaded'. It was originally built in order to automate the prediction of applications submitted, for employees who use SEIBEL CRM (software to send, manage and receive grants) to track applications and their status to make business decisions, However, it can be used whenever a prediction has to be made regarding the number of applications that will be submitted.
